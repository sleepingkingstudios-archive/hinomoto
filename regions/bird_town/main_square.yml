  You are in the main square of Bird Town, the village where you grew up. At
  the center of the square is a large bronze statue of two great birds in
  flight. The village inn is nearby, where you can find the shopkeeper and any
  visitors to the town. Opposite the inn is a small cluster of houses, built in
  the traditional style.

  Up the mountain, you can see the winding length of Bird Trail, which runs
  from the village square up to the sacred Bird Shrine near the summit.
  Opposite the trail through a sturdy vermillion gate is Route 1, leading down
  the mountain to Bronze City.
