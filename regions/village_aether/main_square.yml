name: the main square of the Village of Aether
description: >
  You are in the main square of the Village of Aether, the town where you grew
  up. At the center of the square is a large bronze statue of two great birds
  in flight. The village inn is nearby, where you can find the shopkeeper and
  any visitors to the town, as well as the village's famous hot springs.
  Opposite the inn is a small cluster of houses, built in the traditional
  style.
  
  Up the slopes of Mount Electrum, you can see the winding length of Bird
  Trail, which runs from the village square up to the sacred Bird Shrine near
  the summit. Opposite the trail through a sturdy vermillion gate is Route 1,
  leading down the mountain toward Bronze City.
