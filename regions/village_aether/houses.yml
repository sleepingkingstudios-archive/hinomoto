name: "the Village of Aether, among the houses"
description: >
  You are on a short path paved with flat stones, winding between a cluster of
  houses. Each house is similar in appearance, with traditional wooden walls
  and curved slate roofs, but each has a few personal touches: a carefully
  tended garden, an ornamental pool, an elegant statue, a proud cherry tree.
  
  Your house is close by, as is the Nome house, the home of priestess Nome and
  her three daughters.
